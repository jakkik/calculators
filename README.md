### Calculators ###

Need to calculate some SHA1-hashes? Want to generate a few Finnish
national identification numbers (hetu)? 

This repo contains the source code for a static web page that has all 
those nifty calculators working in the browser. No data is sent anywhere,
so you can calculate password hashes safely.

### Installation instructions ###

No steps needed. Just view the page src/index.html in your browser.
